## 📂 Core Concepts Covered

1. **Routing** 📍  
   NextJS offers both the App Router and Pages Router for defining routes. You'll learn how to work with file-based routing, dynamic routes, and catch-all routes.

2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Site Generation (SSG)** 🌐  
   NextJS allows for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), giving you the flexibility to choose the best rendering method for your application. You’ll learn how to optimize performance by pre-rendering pages on the server.

3. **Data Fetching** 🦸‍♂️  
   Data fetching is an essential part of any React app. You’ll learn how to fetch data from APIs using NextJS’s `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, and React hooks. We'll also cover Server Actions and API Routes.

4. **Authentication** 🔒  
   You’ll implement authentication in your app, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their sessions with ease.

5. **Optimization & SEO** 📈  
   NextJS includes many built-in optimizations such as image optimization, metadata handling, and SEO-friendly pre-rendering. Learn how to make your app fast and SEO-friendly by using these features.
